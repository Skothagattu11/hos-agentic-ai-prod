OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------

    "signature": "New Foundation-Builder who is already protecting sleep (Sleep Score 0.81, Sleep Efficiency high, very low sleep debt) and collecting high-quality data, but is not yet translating good recovery/readiness (Readiness 0.81) into regular physical activity (Activity Score 0.41, only 27 brief sessions vs 23 sleep periods). Mental-wellbeing is moderate (0.69) and stable, suggesting no acute stress yet. Overall pattern: early-stage habit former with strong sleep routine, inconsistent movement, and curiosity for tracking.",
    "confidence": 0.55
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 27,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Excellent data capture indicates enthusiasm, but behavior patterns are basic and limited in scope (only two days of metric history, minimal structured activity, no established long-term routines)."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Build a reliable daily movement habit while maintaining strong sleep hygiene",
    "timeline": "First 4\u20136 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "Raise Activity Score average from 0.41 \u2192 \u22650.60; complete \u22655 purposeful activity sessions/week (\u226520 min each, RPE 4\u20136/10); keep Sleep Score \u22650.80 in \u226580 % of nights."
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Feeling well-rested, seeing simple metrics improve, celebrating small streaks, positive reinforcement from \u2018checking the box\u2019.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor a 15-20 min brisk walk (or comparable low-impact option) immediately after a consistent daily cue (e.g., morning coffee). Pair with 5-min evening stretch routine attached to bedtime prep to reinforce sleep focus.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Lay out walking shoes/clothes the night before; schedule a recurring calendar reminder; keep intensity low to avoid soreness; track completion in the same app to get instant visual feedback."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Maintain current sleep schedule; target fixed lights-out and wake-time \u00b130 min for the next 14 days.",
    "Add one additional low-to-moderate activity session every other day this week (target 2 km walk or 2,000 extra steps).",
    "Use the Readiness score each morning: if \u22650.80, extend walk by 5 min or add light body-weight circuit (squats, wall push-ups, 2 sets).",
    "Log a quick 1\u201310 mood check each evening to enrich Mental_Wellbeing data and catch stress early.",
    "Perform 2-minute diaphragmatic breathing break at midday to support HRV and mental recovery.",
    "Review metrics every Sunday night; celebrate any streak \u22653 consecutive activity days and adjust step goal upward by 5 % if Activity Score >0.60 for the week."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Sleep and Readiness are strong (both 0.81) with high efficiency and negligible debt, confirming adequate recovery capacity. Respiratory rate, SpO2, and resting heart metrics sit in expected healthy ranges, reinforcing that increased light-to-moderate activity is safe. Activity Score is the largest gap (0.41) despite 27 logged sessions, indicating sessions are either very short or low intensity. Mental-wellbeing is moderate (0.69) but stable; proactive movement and brief breathing practice should raise this metric. Overall, physiological readiness is under-utilized\u2014the user can safely shift a portion of recovered energy toward foundational movement without jeopardizing sleep quality.",
