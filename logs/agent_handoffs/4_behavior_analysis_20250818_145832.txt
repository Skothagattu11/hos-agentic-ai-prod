OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "At present no objective health-tracking data is available (0% coverage for activity, sleep, and biomarkers). The dominant behavioral pattern is \u2018non-tracking / setup not completed\u2019, characteristic of an early-stage Foundation Builder who has not yet established basic measurement routines.",
    "confidence": 0.15
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 15,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Absence of any recorded data or established routines suggests the user is just starting their health-optimization journey and has not yet mastered basic self-monitoring skills."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable baseline of daily activity and sleep data",
    "timeline": "Next 14 days",
    "success_metrics": "\u226510 of the next 14 days with valid step count and sleep duration recorded; completion of an initial self-assessment questionnaire"

    "motivation_drivers": "Simplicity, quick wins, and visible progress feedback",
    "habit_integration": "Pair nightly phone charging with starting sleep tracking; enable automatic step syncing each morning",

  },
  "readiness_level": "Low",
  "recommendations": [
    "Download and install a basic tracker (e.g., Google Fit, Apple Health, or a simple wearable) and confirm it records steps automatically.",
    "Enable sleep-tracking (automatic if using a smartwatch, or manually tap \u2018start\u2019/\u2018stop\u2019 in the chosen app) every night for the next two weeks.",
    "Set a single daily reminder at 9 pm to prepare for sleep tracking and at 8 am to confirm data synced; disable other notifications to avoid overload.",
    "Complete a 5-minute self-assessment survey covering current energy, mood, and perceived stress to create a subjective baseline.",
    "Schedule a 15-minute review session after two weeks to evaluate data coverage and adjust the plan."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Because no activity, sleep, or biomarker entries are present, the immediate insight is a setup gap rather than a physiological trend. The priority is to establish consistent data capture so that meaningful patterns can be identified in future analyses.",
