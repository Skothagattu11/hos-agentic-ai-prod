OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "New Foundation Builder showing relatively strong sleep hygiene (high sleep metric, low interruptions, acceptable latency) but minimal structured activity (only two logged sessions, activity metric in lower-medium range). Mental wellbeing and overall readiness are moderate, indicating capacity for change if guided with simple, confidence-building steps. Engagement so far is sparse but data quality is excellent, hinting at conscientiousness once tasks are defined.",
    "confidence": 0.62
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 25,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "First week of tracking, very limited interaction history, and archetype is Foundation Builder. User demonstrates reliable data capture but no sustained habit signals yet; thus beginner sophistication."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable daily movement routine while preserving good sleep quality",
    "timeline": "First 4-6 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 \u22655 days/week with \u22657,500 steps or \u226520 min moderate activity logged\n\u2022 Sleep Efficiency maintained \u226585 %\n\u2022 Self-rated mental wellbeing \u22650.80 average by week 6"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Confidence from quick wins, visible progress tracking, and feeling more energized during the day",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor a 15-20 min walk immediately after a consistent daily event (e.g., after lunch) and use bedtime alarm to keep sleep start time within a 30-minute window",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Start with low-friction activities (walking, gentle stretching) to avoid overwhelm; pre-commit by laying out walking shoes the night before; use phone reminders and single-tap logging to reduce cognitive load"
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Schedule a 20-minute walk or equivalent light activity at least 5 days this coming week; log it in the tracker.",
    "Maintain current sleep window by setting a bedtime reminder 30 minutes before preferred sleep start.",
    "Perform a 2-minute evening reflection: note energy, mood, and one positive event; reinforces mental wellbeing metric tracking.",
    "Check readiness score each morning; if <0.65, replace planned walk with gentle stretching to preserve recovery.",
    "Review progress every Sunday evening; celebrate completions and set the next week\u2019s simple targets."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Sleep metrics (avg 0.81) are the strongest pillar; latency and interruptions are low, indicating restorative sleep. Activity metric (0.54) lags and only two sessions were recorded, pointing to an opportunity for foundational movement habits. Mental wellbeing (0.74) is solid but could benefit from consistent daytime activity. Readiness (0.77) suggests physiological capacity for increased movement without compromising recovery.",
