OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "As a new Peak Performer\u2013type user, the only discernible pattern is a complete absence of recorded health-tracking activity over the first 24-hour observation window. This suggests either (a) no sensors/devices are yet integrated, (b) the user has not synchronized data, or (c) the user is still exploring the platform before committing to continuous tracking. For Peak Performers, an initial data void typically reflects a \u2018setup phase\u2019 rather than lack of motivation.",
    "confidence": 0.22
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 35,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Although the archetype implies high sophistication, the practical execution (0 % data coverage, DataQualityLevel.POOR) places the current operational sophistication at a beginner level. Until reliable data streams exist, advanced analytics or bio-optimization protocols would be premature."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable, high-resolution baseline of key performance metrics (sleep, activity, biomarkers) within the next 14 days.",
    "timeline": "Day 0\u201314: full device onboarding and baseline capture; Day 15\u201330: pattern identification and first optimization loop.",
    "success_metrics": "\u226590 % daily data completeness across steps/activity, HR/HRV, sleep duration/quality; at least one biomarker panel uploaded; automatic data sync confirmed by the system log."
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Peak Performers respond to quantifiable progress, competitive benchmarking, and rapid feedback loops.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor device sync to an existing immutable routine (e.g., first coffee or post-workout shower). Use automated reminders until a 10-day streak is achieved, then taper prompts.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Provide step-by-step device setup guide; enable \u2018sync diagnostic\u2019 push notification to catch missed uploads; schedule a 5-minute nightly \u2018data check\u2019 ritual to prevent gaps."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Complete hardware/app integration checklist today (wearable, smart-scale, blood testing service).",
    "Run a 24-hour \u2018data echo\u2019 test tomorrow\u2014verify that sleep, resting HR, steps, and calorie burn all appear in the dashboard.",
    "Enable auto-sync and confirm background refresh permissions on the phone.",
    "Book initial comprehensive biomarker panel within the next 7 days; use that lab date as the anchor for future quarterly testing.",

  ],
  "data_insights": "No physiological or behavioral trends can be inferred because all tracked metrics are missing. The most important insight is the critical need to transition from \u2018zero data\u2019 to \u2018minimum viable telemetry\u2019 before any deeper behavioral pattern recognition or optimization can occur.",
