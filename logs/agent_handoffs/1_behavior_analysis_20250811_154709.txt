OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "User shows reliable basic self-tracking (6 sleep + 6 activity logs in 7 days) with solid sleep hygiene (Sleep score 0.81, upward trend) and strong mental wellbeing (0.83). Physical activity is present but remains in a \u2018medium\u2019 zone (Activity score 0.63) with single-measurement biomarkers suggesting mostly sedentary patterns (recorded Activity Sedentary Duration; one low-intensity session, minimal floors climbed). Engagement pattern fits a Foundation Builder profile: consistent but low-complexity routines, openness to guidance, and preference for small achievable steps.",
    "confidence": 0.78
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 34,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Data capture is consistent, but behavior change tactics are still basic (few activity modalities, no intensity variation). Biomarker set is narrow\u2014indicates early stage experimentation rather than advanced self-optimization."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Build a sustainable daily movement habit that elevates Activity score from 0.63 \u2192 \u22650.70 without compromising sleep quality.",
    "timeline": "8\u201310 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 \u22657,500 average daily steps for 4 consecutive weeks\n\u2022 \u2265150 min/week of low-to-moderate intensity movement logged\n\u2022 Activity score \u22650.70 maintained for 3 weeks while Sleep score stays \u22650.78"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Enjoyment of feeling rested; visible progress tracking; confidence from accomplishing small, clearly defined tasks.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor a 20-minute post-wake walk or light routine immediately after morning hydration; stack 2\u00d75-minute stretch breaks onto existing screen-time pauses (mid-morning, mid-afternoon). Use wearable reminders already trusted for sleep tracking.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "1) Overwhelm \u2192 cap new habits at <30 min/day for first 3 weeks.\n2) Forgetfulness \u2192 schedule phone/wearable prompt synced with usual wake time.\n3) Weather/environment \u2192 have an indoor back-up (guided video or hallway steps)."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Add one additional low-intensity activity session on non-exercise days (e.g., 15-min walk after lunch).",
    "Set a weekly step target: start at current average +1,000; increase by 500 each week until 7,500 is met comfortably.",
    "Continue current sleep routine; log bedtime and wake time to preserve 0.81 score trend.",
    "Perform a 2-minute breathing or gratitude check-in before bed to reinforce strong mental wellbeing metrics.",
    "Schedule a 4-week progress review to adjust targets and celebrate milestones."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Sleep and mental wellbeing are strengths (high trend scores). Physical activity requires gentle scaling: only 1 registered low-intensity bout and singular step record indicate limited daily movement. Biomarkers (resting HR, HRV, SpO2) are normal but sparse; continued collection will allow clearer baselines. Consistent logging shows user reliability, supporting incremental habit layering without risk of data fatigue.",
