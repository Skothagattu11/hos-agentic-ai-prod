OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "User exhibits a classic Foundation Builder pattern: engagement is earnest but irregular, with noticeable gaps between healthy behavior clusters. When sessions do occur they are short-to-moderate in duration and skew toward low-intensity, entry-level activities (e.g., short walks, brief body-weight routines, basic food logging). Completion rates rise when tasks are explicitly prompted and simplified, but decay when complexity or required planning time climbs. The user tends to front-load new habits early in the week and loses momentum by day-4 or after minor life disruptions. Stress-related markers (elevated resting HR, reduced sleep efficiency) precede skipped sessions, suggesting capacity constraints are a primary driver of inconsistency. Overall, the pattern signals high willingness but low automaticity, with environment and energy fluctuations strongly modulating adherence.",
    "confidence": 0.63
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 32,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Data show reliance on app prompts, minimal self-initiated habit stacking, and limited use of advanced tracking features. Logging accuracy is acceptable but lacks depth (e.g., broad food categories rather than macros). The user rarely employs reflection notes or in-app trend analyses, indicating early-stage behavioral sophistication."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable, low-effort daily wellness routine (movement + sleep consistency + balanced meals).",
    "timeline": "3\u20134 months to reach 80% routine adherence on non-travel weeks.",
    "success_metrics": "1) \u22658,000 steps on \u22655 days/week; 2) 7\u20138 h sleep with <15 % wake-after-sleep time on \u22654 nights/week; 3) balanced plate (\u00bd veg/fruit, \u00bc protein, \u00bc complex carbs) logged at \u226510 meals/week."
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Positive feedback loops, visible progress badges, and social support from close friends/family. Responds well to gentle encouragement and quick wins rather than competitive challenges.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor micro-habits to existing morning and evening routines (e.g., 5-min mobility while coffee brews; set phone to \u2018sleep mode\u2019 at 22:30). Use single-tap pre-set food logs for recurring meals to lower friction.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Plan for energy dips by preparing \u2018minimum viable\u2019 options (10-min walk, 2-min breathing drill). Utilize calendar holds and push-notification reminders at historically successful time blocks (07:30\u201308:00 & 20:30\u201321:00). Pre-commit with accountability partner on Sundays to outline the week."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement a \u20182-for-1\u2019 rule: if a planned full workout is missed, complete at least a 2-minute mobility or breathing session within the same day to keep the habit chain intact.",
    "Schedule a consistent wind-down alarm at 22:15 to cue tech shut-off and stretch routine; this correlates with observed improvements in sleep efficiency on prior well-rested days.",
    "Batch-prep two balanced lunches every Sunday and Wednesday to secure at least four high-quality meals per workweek.",
    "Enable passive step accumulation by adding a 5-minute walk after every main meal (3\u00d7/day = 15 min \u2248 1,500\u20132,000 steps).",
    "Turn on weekly progress summaries: visual streaks will leverage the user\u2019s response to positive reinforcement without needing deep data analysis on their part.",
    "Set a monthly \u2018reflection checkpoint\u2019 (guided in-app questionnaire) to gradually build self-assessment skills and move toward Intermediate sophistication."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Timestamped dataset indicates good objective quality (no major signal gaps, sensor sync <5 % error), but behavioral volatility is evident: median task completion 57 %, SD 26 %. Activity peaks Mondays/Tuesdays (mean step count 9,200) and troughs Fridays (mean 5,100). Sleep duration averages 6.7 h with better efficiency (90 %) on days following completed evening routines versus 82 % when skipped. Elevated resting HR (+6 bpm above baseline) and reduced HRV (-12 ms) consistently appear 24 h before missed workouts, corroborating stress-capacity linkage.",
