OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "Absence-of-data pattern: the user has not yet recorded any sleep, activity, or biomarker metrics, indicating (a) either no tracking devices/apps are connected or (b) initial engagement/technical setup is incomplete. This fits a \u2018Foundation Builder\u2019 starting profile in which the very first hurdle is establishing simple, reliable data-capture habits.",
    "confidence": 0.15
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 10,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "No objective data streams are present; the user has not demonstrated familiarity with tracking or structured habit logging yet."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Create a reliable baseline by capturing one daily movement metric (steps) and one nightly recovery metric (sleep duration/quality).",
    "timeline": "Next 14 days",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 \u226510 days with valid step count\n\u2022 \u226510 nights with recorded sleep duration\n\u2022 User self-report: confidence \u22657/10 in using tracking tools"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Quick feedback loops, visible progress bars, reassurance that small actions matter",
    "habit_integration": "1. Morning: put on step-tracking device/app before first drink/meal.\n2. Evening: initiate sleep-tracking mode when getting into bed.\n3. Weekly 5-min review: glance at the simple trend chart supplied by the app.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "\u2022 Provide a one-page \u2018Getting Started\u2019 guide with screenshots for device/app setup.\n\u2022 Set phone reminders titled \u201cJust press start \u2013 5 seconds\u201d to reduce mental load.\n\u2022 Offer an accountability prompt: brief check-in message from coach/AI every 3 days until \u226510 data points are logged."

  "readiness_level": "Low-Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Connect one step-tracking tool today (phone pedometer or wearable). Confirm it shows steps by taking 20\u201330 steps.",
    "Enable automatic sleep detection or manually activate a basic sleep-tracking feature tonight.",
    "Disable unnecessary app notifications except the single reminder at morning and bedtime to keep cognitive load minimal.",
    "At the end of Day 3, open the tracking app and note total steps and sleep hours; celebrate completion regardless of numbers.",

  "data_insights": "No health metrics were captured between 2025-08-17 and 2025-08-18 (DataQualityLevel.POOR; coverage 0%). This suggests initial engagement/setup is the immediate priority before any deeper behavioral or physiological analysis can occur.",
