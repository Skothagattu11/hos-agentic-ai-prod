Analyze these health indicators to identify patterns, trends, and insights that align with the Foundation Builder framework. Focus on actionable observations from the provided health metrics while considering the user's memory profile and proven strategies.\n",

OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "Early-stage Foundation Builder with no measurable tracking habits yet. Shows willingness to engage (requested analysis) but has not established any consistent data-logging behaviors across activity, sleep, or biomarkers.",
    "confidence": 0.25
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 15,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Absence of recorded sessions and biomarkers suggests the user is at the very start of their self-tracking journey and still learning the basics of data capture."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable baseline of core health metrics (steps, sleep duration, resting heart rate).",
    "timeline": "First 14 days",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 \u22655 days/week of step count logging\n\u2022 \u22655 nights/week of sleep duration logging\n\u2022 At least one resting-heart-rate reading each week"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Simplicity, small wins, and clear feedback loops typical of Foundation Builders.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor tracking to existing daily cues (e.g., record steps when putting phone on charger at night, start sleep tracking when getting into bed). Use one single app/wearable to reduce friction.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "1) Technical friction \u2192 Provide step-by-step setup guide.\n2) Forgetfulness \u2192 Enable automatic reminders at bedtime and after waking.\n3) Overwhelm \u2192 Limit initial focus to ONLY steps and sleep for the first two weeks."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Low-Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Choose one wearable or smartphone app today that automatically records steps and sleep.",
    "Perform a 5-minute \u2018tech check\u2019 tonight: ensure the device is charged, paired, and sleep-tracking is turned on.",
    "Set two calendar reminders: \u2018Start sleep tracking\u2019 at usual bedtime and \u2018Review my data\u2019 at a convenient morning time.",
    "At the end of each day, jot down one sentence about energy level; this qualitative note will enrich future quantitative data.",
    "After 14 days, export or sync the data so we can run the first true pattern analysis."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Current data coverage is 0 %. No activity sessions, sleep cycles, or biomarkers were recorded between 2025-08-17 and 2025-08-18. This indicates that the primary behavioral bottleneck is not physiological but procedural\u2014data is simply not being captured. Initiating a low-friction tracking routine is therefore the critical next step before deeper health insights are possible.",
