OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "User shows reliably high sleep quality and physiological readiness, but engages in minimal physical activity. Mental wellbeing and overall perceived wellbeing sit at moderate levels, suggesting neither acute distress nor peak positivity. Patterns indicate a preference (or default) for recovery behaviors (good sleep hygiene) over activation behaviors (structured exercise). Consistency is observable in sleep logging (23 sleep periods vs 27 activity sessions), implying the user is comfortable tracking passive data but less proactive in logging or performing deliberate exercise.",
    "confidence": 0.72
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 28,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "As a Foundation Builder with no prior long-term data, the user demonstrates solid passive-data habits (sleep tracking) but has yet to adopt regular, intentional movement or advanced self-measurement protocols. Engagement level and metric variety are characteristic of an early-stage health optimizer."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a consistent baseline of daily physical activity while preserving current high-quality sleep patterns.",
    "timeline": "Next 6\u20138 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 Raise Activity Metric from 0.41 \u2192 0.60 (\u226546 tracked activity sessions over next 30 days)\n\u2022 Maintain Sleep Metric \u22650.80 (average) with <10% sleep debt"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Quick wins, visible progress, and reassurance that small efforts compound over time. Positive feedback loops around maintained sleep quality will reinforce daytime activity.",
    "habit_integration": "\u2022 Anchor a 10-minute brisk walk immediately after waking routine (piggyback on established good sleep/wake cycle).\n\u2022 Schedule two 5-minute movement snacks (stretch or stairs) at mid-morning and mid-afternoon alarms.\n\u2022 Use the same device/app already recording sleep to auto-detect steps or movement\u2014minimizes friction.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "\u2022 Time scarcity \u2192 keep activities <10 min at first.\n\u2022 Overwhelm \u2192 single focus: \u2018move daily\u2019, ignore advanced metrics until baseline is solid.\n\u2022 Motivation dips \u2192 pair walks with enjoyable podcast or music; log completion for visual streak."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium-High",
  "recommendations": [
    "Add one low-intensity 10-min walk every morning for the next 7 days; mark completion.",
    "Set smartphone alarms at 10:30 AM and 3:30 PM for 5-min stretch or stair session.",
    "Keep bedtime and wake-time within a 30-minute window to preserve current sleep efficiency.",
    "Review Activity Metric after 14 days\u2014target \u22650.50; if met, increment morning walk to 15 min.",
    "Continue passive tracking of oxygen saturation, HRV, and resting heart rate; flag any >10% deviation.",
    "Journal one sentence nightly on mood to tie activity changes to mental wellbeing (build self-awareness)."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Sleep (0.81) and Readiness (0.81) scores are high with just 2 measurements each, showing consistently restorative nights. Activity score (0.41) is well below sleep metrics, indicating an imbalance that limits overall wellbeing improvement. Mental wellbeing (0.69) and general wellbeing (0.66) sit in the mid-range, often correlated with moderate but improvable activity levels. Biomarker snapshot (HRV, resting HR, SpO\u2082) shows no red flags, supporting a safe window to introduce light activity. High data coverage (100%) and excellent quality suggest the user reliably logs passive metrics, giving confidence that new activity data will be captured accurately.",
