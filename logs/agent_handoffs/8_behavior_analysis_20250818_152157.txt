OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "User is at the very beginning of their health-optimization journey. No sleep, activity, or biomarker data have been logged, indicating (a) minimal familiarity with the tracking tools or (b) possible overwhelm or uncertainty about how to start. Engagement pattern is \u2018blank-slate\u2019 with zero completion events, suggesting the need for confidence-building, guided set-up, and extremely simple first steps.",
    "confidence": 0.25
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 15,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Absence of any recorded metrics and DataQualityLevel.POOR show the user has not yet begun consistent self-tracking or habit formation. This places them firmly in the Foundation Builder/Beginner stage."

  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable baseline of daily activity and sleep tracking",
    "timeline": "First 2\u20133 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "\u22655 days per week with: (1) step count OR 10-min movement log, (2) sleep start/end time entry, and (3) one subjective energy or mood check-in"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Clear guidance, quick wins, and visible progress badges that build confidence",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor a 1-minute \u2018daily setup\u2019 routine each morning to confirm devices are charged or open the tracking app; pair evening phone put-away with entering sleep time.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Provide in-app walkthrough for device/app setup; pre-schedule gentle reminders; offer \u2018skip without guilt\u2019 option to reduce perfectionism pressure."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Low-Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Complete the HolisticOS 3-step \u2018Getting Started\u2019 wizard today (device connection, notification preferences, first baseline survey). Estimated time: 6 minutes.",
    "Set a micro-goal of one 10-minute walk daily after lunch; log it with a single tap. This creates the first activity data point and an immediate sense of achievement.",
    "Use the built-in sleep journal tonight: simply press \u2018Start Sleep\u2019 when you lie down and \u2018End Sleep\u2019 on waking. No extra details needed yet.",
    "Turn on automatic daily reminder at 8 p.m. labelled \u2018One small log = one big win\u2019 to reinforce consistency without judgment.",
    "Review the first week\u2019s summary (auto-generated) next Monday; celebrate every logged entry regardless of quantity."
  ],
  "data_insights": "The complete absence of recorded sessions (0 activity, 0 sleep, 0 biomarkers) reveals that we are pre-baseline. Before deriving any physiological or behavioral trends, we must first create data flow. Action priority therefore shifts from optimization to initiation: remove technical/friction barriers, build user confidence, and capture the first few data points. Once \u226530% data coverage is achieved over a 14-day window, richer pattern analysis can begin.",
