OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "New Foundation Builder who is already demonstrating high voluntary engagement with tracking tools (100 % data coverage, 20 health-score samples in a week). Patterns show regular sleep logging (4 nights), four distinct activity sessions, and consistently elevated scores for Mental Well-being (0.85), Sleep (0.82) and General Well-being (0.85). Readiness (0.67) lags slightly, suggesting that while the user feels good, physiological recovery capacity is only moderate. Behavior is orderly and routine-oriented, but still early-stage with limited variability, indicating an emerging habit-builder who benefits from clear structure and positive feedback.",
    "confidence": 0.55
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 40,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "User is new to HolisticOS (no prior memory) and belongs to the Foundation Builder archetype. Excellent data capture shows enthusiasm, but the behavioral dataset is shallow (7-day window, 4 sleep cycles, 4 activity sessions). Engagement is promising, yet skill with interpretation, recovery balancing, and habit layering is likely nascent."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a stable baseline routine that keeps Mental Well-being, Sleep, and Activity scores \u2265 0.80 while lifting Readiness to \u2265 0.75.",
    "timeline": "4-week onboarding phase (2025-08-18 \u2192 2025-09-15)",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 Average daily Readiness score \u2265 0.75 for 5 consecutive days\n\u2022 Maintain \u2265 90 % logging compliance (sleep + activity)\n\u2022 Self-reported energy \u2265 8/10 at least 4 days per week"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Positive feedback loops, visible progress badges, and simple daily wins build confidence.",
    "habit_integration": "1) Bedtime wind-down alarm 30 min before target sleep time.\n2) 10-min morning mobility or walk directly after waking to reinforce activity cue.\n3) Single hydration checkpoint: fill 500 ml bottle after morning mobility and finish by 10 AM.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "\u2022 If schedule pressure arises, allow 'minimum viable' versions (5-min stretch, 5-min breathwork) to preserve streaks.\n\u2022 Set app reminder to prompt logging within 15 min of waking and before dinner to avoid missing data.\n\u2022 Prepare sleep environment (dim lights, phone on charger outside bedroom) to counter late-night screen temptation."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Keep bedtime/wake-time within a 30-minute window for the next week to consolidate circadian rhythm.",
    "Add one low-intensity recovery session (e.g., 15-min walk or gentle yoga) on days without formal workouts to improve readiness.",
    "Perform a 2-minute breathing practice after lunch to down-shift sympathetic drive and enhance afternoon focus.",
    "Log a brief mood note each morning; tagging stressors will help refine future behavioral predictions.",
    "Aim for \u2265 6,000 steps on non-exercise days; use phone reminder at 3 PM if step count < 3,000.",
    "Review weekly dashboard every Sunday evening and celebrate at least one win to reinforce motivation."
  ],
  "data_insights": "High scores in Mental Well-being (0.85) and Sleep (0.82) indicate the user is starting from a relatively strong subjective baseline. Activity score (0.87) is also high, yet only four activity sessions were logged, suggesting those sessions were moderately intense but interspersed with sedentary periods (sedentary duration entry present). Readiness sits lower (0.67), hinting that recovery lags behind enthusiasm\u2014consistent with early Foundation Builders who may over-commit. Resting heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal ranges and stable across three measurements, and SpO\u2082 values are healthy, confirming no immediate physiological red flags. The pattern of complete data capture over just one week shows strong early engagement but is too brief for robust trend detection; ongoing monitoring will verify sustainability and highlight any emerging dips in readiness or sleep quality.",
