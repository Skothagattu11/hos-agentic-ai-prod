OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "New Foundation Builder with solid sleep hygiene (Sleep Metric 0.81) and generally adequate readiness (0.77) but limited structured activity (Activity Metric 0.54, only 2 logged sessions). Mental-wellbeing scores are fair (0.74) and general wellbeing is moderate (0.68). Pattern suggests the user naturally protects sleep but has not yet built reliable movement or recovery-support routines. No contradictory behaviors or large day-to-day swings detected across the single-week sample, indicating stable but undeveloped health habits.",
    "confidence": 0.62
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 35,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Excellent data quality shows good device/ app competence, yet only core metrics are being tracked and health behaviors are basic. No advanced self-experimentation or periodized training visible; habits appear in early formation."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Build a consistent, low-friction daily movement routine while maintaining strong sleep quality.",
    "timeline": "First 4-6 weeks for habit establishment, review at week 8.",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 Raise Activity Metric average from 0.54 \u2192 \u22650.65 (\u224820% gain)\n\u2022 Maintain Sleep Metric \u22650.80\n\u2022 Log \u22655 movement sessions per week (\u226515 min each)"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Quick wins that boost daytime energy and mood; positive feedback from wearable stats; social encouragement from friends/family.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor a 15-minute walk or gentle mobility routine immediately after a fixed daily cue (e.g., lunch). Start with \u2018minimum-viable\u2019 sessions to ensure success, then layer optional add-ons (body-weight circuit, stretching). Keep bedtime and wake-time within a 30-minute window to protect current sleep strength.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "\u2022 Time scarcity \u2192 use micro-sessions (5-minute movement snacks) when full session isn\u2019t possible.\n\u2022 Low confidence \u2192 track streaks visually and celebrate weekly consistency rather than intensity.\n\u2022 Environment \u2192 prepare walking shoes by the door; choose indoor backup routine for bad weather."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Schedule a 15-minute post-lunch walk every weekday; log it in your tracker to raise Activity sessions from 2 to 5+ per week.",
    "Add a 5-minute evening stretch right before your established bedtime routine to reinforce sleep cueing and enhance recovery.",
    "Keep sleep window consistent (\u00b130 min) to preserve the strong 0.81 Sleep Metric; set a phone reminder 45 minutes before target bedtime to start winding down.",
    "Perform a Sunday quick-review: glance at Activity and Sleep metrics, note wins, and plan your coming week\u2019s movement slots.",
    "After two weeks of \u22655 walks/week, consider lengthening two of them to 25 minutes or adding light resistance bands to introduce progressive overload."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Sleep quality is the standout strength (high metric, minimal interruptions, adequate duration). Readiness sits comfortably, likely benefiting from sleep but could be negatively affected by low daytime movement. Activity is the clearest opportunity\u2014only two sessions logged over the week with an Activity Metric of 0.54, well below the user\u2019s other domains. Mental-wellbeing is decent and does not show acute stress spikes, so introducing gentle activity should be tolerated. No red-flag biomarkers (e.g., respiratory rate) appear; overall profile is stable but under-developed.",
