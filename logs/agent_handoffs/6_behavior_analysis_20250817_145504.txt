    "signature": "New Foundation Builder user shows strong sleep quality and physiological readiness (Sleep Score \u2248 0.81; Readiness \u2248 0.81) but very limited daily movement (Activity Score \u2248 0.41). Mental-wellbeing and general wellbeing are moderate (\u2248 0.69 & 0.66). Engagement with the tracker has been high (100 % data coverage; 27 activity logs, 23 sleep logs in two days), indicating early-stage enthusiasm and capacity for basic self-monitoring. No long-term patterns are yet established, so current behavior is best viewed as a baseline snapshot rather than a stable routine.",

  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 28,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Archetype = Foundation Builder; first data set with no prior successes/failures recorded; metrics suggest the user is just starting structured health optimization and has not yet integrated consistent physical-activity habits."

  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Early wins, clear structure, and visible progress badges; emphasis on feeling more energized (already suggested by high readiness scores)",
    "habit_integration": "Attach a 10-min brisk walk to an existing daily anchor (e.g., morning coffee); expand by 5 min every week until 30 min is reached; schedule movement in calendar reminders 30 min before usual low-activity periods identified in logs.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Prepare walking shoes/clothes the night before; set inactivity alerts on phone; pre-select indoor mini-workouts for bad-weather days to reduce friction."

  "recommendations": [
    "Start \u201810-Minute Morning Movement\u2019: 10 min brisk walk immediately after waking routine for the next 7 days.",
    "Add one 2-min micro-stretch break every 90 minutes of sedentary time (use phone timer).",
    "Keep sleep schedule within \u00b130 min of current sleep end time to preserve high sleep efficiency (currently strong).",
    "Log a short mood check after the morning walk to capture mental-wellbeing response; this builds reflection habit and feeds future personalization.",
