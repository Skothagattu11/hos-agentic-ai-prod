OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "User shows consistently good sleep quality (Sleep score 0.81, 15 cycles logged) and strong physiological recovery (Readiness 0.88). Despite this recovered state, daily movement is minimal (Activity score 0.37, high sedentary minutes) and self-reported mental wellbeing is subdued (Mental_Wellbeing 0.59). Pattern suggests a beginner who prioritises rest over activity, has capacity to do more, and may experience mood drag from prolonged sedentary behaviour.",
    "confidence": 0.7
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 25,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Excellent data capture and willingness to track are positives, but behavioural execution is still at the fundamentals stage: low activity volume, limited objective well-being practices, no evidence of structured exercise or stress-management routines."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Build a reliable daily movement habit to raise Activity score toward 0.55+ while preserving current sleep quality.",
    "timeline": "Next 4\u20136 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 Average \u22656,000 steps/day OR \u226530 min cumulative moderate movement on \u22655 days/week\n\u2022 Activity score climbs from 0.37 \u2192 \u22650.55\n\u2022 Mental_Wellbeing score improves from 0.59 \u2192 \u22650.70\n\u2022 Readiness remains \u22650.80 indicating recovery is not compromised"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Quick wins, visible progress, feeling more energetic during the day, positive feedback loops from readiness staying high.",
    "habit_integration": "\u2022 \u201810-Minute Anchor Walks\u2019 after breakfast and lunch (adds ~20 min/day)\n\u2022 Evening stretch or light yoga routine (5\u201310 min) tied to the existing strong bedtime ritual\n\u2022 Use phone or wearable reminders set for 90-minute sitting limits to trigger 2-min movement snacks",
    "barrier_mitigation": "\u2022 Time pressure \u2192 keep movement bouts \u226410 min so they fit into work breaks\n\u2022 Weather \u2192 have an indoor back-up (march in place, body-weight circuits)\n\u2022 Motivation dips \u2192 track streaks in app; celebrate weekly consistency, not perfection"
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Maintain current sleep schedule; keep bedtime/wake-time variance \u226430 min.",
    "Add two 10-min brisk walks Monday\u2013Friday; log as separate activity sessions to reinforce habit.",
    "Perform a 5-min body-weight mobility routine upon waking (squats, hip circles, shoulder rolls).",
    "Set a timer or smart-watch alert every 90 min to stand and move for 2 min during sedentary blocks.",
    "End each day with a brief (3-5 min) gratitude or breathing exercise to target Mental_Wellbeing score.",
    "Re-measure HRV/Resting HR weekly; ensure Readiness stays \u22650.80. If it drops for >2 consecutive days, scale walks to 1/day until recovered."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Sleep consistency is the current anchor habit and likely driving the high Readiness. Activity data (18 sessions) are short and sporadic, producing low aggregate load. Sedentary duration measurement indicates prolonged sitting periods, which aligns with lower mental wellbeing. Biomarkers (HRV SDNN moderate, resting HR normal) show no red flags, supporting immediate capacity for gentle activity escalation without recovery risk.",
