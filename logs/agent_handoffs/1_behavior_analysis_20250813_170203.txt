OUTPUT DATA:

Mental-wellbeing and general wellbeing are moderate, suggesting baseline resilience but room for mood and energy improvements. Overall pattern indicates a \u2018recovery-first, movement-later\u2019 tendency typical of a new Foundation Builder who feels safest tackling rest before exercise.",

  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 28,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "User demonstrates good self-monitoring (excellent data quality) but has not yet built consistent activity or multi-domain habit stacks. Current behaviors reflect early-stage, single-focus optimization (sleep) with minimal complexity."

  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Desire to \u2018feel good every day,\u2019 confidence gained from recent sleep wins, and preference for simple, clearly measurable actions.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor a 10-minute walk immediately after the morning wake routine (piggyback on the already consistent wake time). Once the walk feels automatic (\u2248 3 weeks), extend by 5 minutes or add an afternoon stretch break.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Keep the first goal intentionally small (\u2265 5 minutes counts). Prepare walking shoes the night before to reduce friction. Use a visual calendar or app reminder to celebrate streaks and build confidence."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Maintain current bedtime/wake-time consistency; aim for \u2264 30-minute variance.",
    "Add one light movement session per day (start with 5-10-minute walk). Log it to reinforce success.",
    "Perform a 2-minute evening reflection: note one energy/mood win from the day to strengthen wellbeing awareness.",
    "Hydration check-in each morning (\u2265 250 ml water within 30 minutes of waking).",

  "data_insights": "Sleep-related biomarkers (latency, efficiency, interruptions) all recorded once and appear within healthy ranges, aligning with high sleep and readiness scores. Activity data show only 3 tracked sessions over the week\u2014insufficient to elevate overall activity score. Wellbeing metrics sit in the mid-range (0.58\u20130.67), suggesting that improved movement could meaningfully lift mood and energy without currently competing with recovery needs.",
