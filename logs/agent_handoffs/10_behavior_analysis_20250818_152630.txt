OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "Currently displaying an onboarding-stage pattern: high declared interest (Peak Performer archetype) but zero objective data capture. This suggests either (1) incomplete device/app integration or (2) a delayed start to tracking. There is therefore a gap between stated optimization intent and measurable engagement.",
    "confidence": 0.15
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 55,
    "category": "Intermediate",
    "justification": "The Peak Performer profile indicates a strong grasp of data-driven optimization, yet the absence of any uploaded metrics places actual execution at an early-intermediate level. Once tracking is enabled, sophistication is expected to rise quickly."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable baseline data set across activity, sleep, and key biomarkers to enable future performance optimization.",
    "timeline": "First 14 days",
    "success_metrics": "\u226590 % daily data coverage, \u22651 wearable-captured sleep session per night, and at least one complete biomarker panel logged by day 14."
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Quantitative feedback loops, visible progress dashboards, competitive benchmarking.",
    "habit_integration": "\u2022 Schedule a 5-minute nightly \u2018sync & review\u2019 ritual.\n\u2022 Attach the wearable charge/sync process to an existing evening habit (e.g., brushing teeth).\n\u2022 Use calendar reminders for weekly biomarker or manual entry tasks.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "\u2022 Technical: Provide step-by-step pairing guide for devices; enable automatic cloud backups.\n\u2022 Cognitive: Offer a quick-start dashboard that displays value after just one full day of data.\n\u2022 Friction: Pre-configure notification thresholds so only meaningful alerts are sent, avoiding alert fatigue."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Complete device/app integration today; confirm data flow by verifying a test heart-rate reading.",
    "Enable automatic background syncing and grant required sensor permissions.",
    "Log a manual baseline of resting heart rate, body weight, and a subjective energy score (1-10) to seed the system.",
    "Schedule first comprehensive biomarker panel within the next 7 days\u2014fasted glucose, lipid profile, hs-CRP, thyroid panel.",
    "Aim for \u22657 h tracked sleep tonight using the wearable; tag sleep quality subjectively upon waking.",
    "Review the initial 24-hour data summary tomorrow and set micro-targets (e.g., +500 daily steps, sleep before 23:00).",
    "Reassess data completeness at the end of the first week; if <80 % coverage, troubleshoot and resolve gaps immediately."
  ],
  "data_insights": "DataQualityLevel is POOR with 0 % coverage across August 17-18. No activity sessions, sleep cycles, or biomarker entries were detected. The primary actionable insight is that engagement with tracking hardware/software is the critical first bottleneck; no physiological conclusions can be drawn until data capture begins.",
