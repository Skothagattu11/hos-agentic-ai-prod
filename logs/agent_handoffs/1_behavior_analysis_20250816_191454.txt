OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "Early-stage self-tracker who checks in sporadically but with very high data quality when they do engage. Physical-health scores (well-being, activity, sleep) are clustered in the low-40s, while subjective Mental and Energy scores are high (>70), suggesting a cognitive-dominant profile that may overlook basic recovery behaviors. Engagement shows four discrete activity logs and four sleep logs in one week, indicating the user is experimenting rather than following a stable routine. Sleep timing variables (start, end, mid-point) vary day-to-day, hinting at an inconsistent bedtime window. Overall pattern = motivated curiosity with limited structure, typical of a Foundation Builder at Day 0.",
    "confidence": 0.28
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 22,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "First week of logging, small sample size, no clear routines yet, and key foundational metrics (sleep duration/efficiency, activity frequency) are well below generally accepted baselines."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a stable sleep-wake schedule and minimum-viable daily movement routine",
    "timeline": "Next 8 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "1) Average sleep score \u226570 for 5 consecutive nights; 2) Activity score \u226560 with \u22655 logged movement sessions per week; 3) \u226590 % weekly data capture for sleep and activity."
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Desire for consistent energy and mental clarity; satisfaction from seeing objective numbers improve; positive feedback loops.",
    "habit_integration": "a) Fixed \u2018digital sunset\u2019 60 min before target bedtime; b) 10-min morning light exposure + 15-min walk to anchor circadian rhythm; c) Use phone reminder to log sleep + activity daily at the same time.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Keep goals bite-sized (one change per week); attach new habits to existing anchors (e.g., brush teeth \u2192 phone in charger outside bedroom); set weekly reflection alarm every Sunday to review scores and choose one micro-improvement."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Pick a fixed bedtime within a 30-min window (e.g., 11:00-11:30 PM) and aim for 7 h time-in-bed for the next 7 nights.",
    "Schedule one 20-30 min low-intensity activity (walk, gentle bike) on four non-consecutive days this week; log each session immediately after completion.",
    "Add a 5-min pre-bed wind-down ritual (stretching or diaphragmatic breathing) to reduce sleep latency.",
    "Place phone on charge outside the bedroom to curb late-night screen exposure (improves sleep efficiency).",
    "Set one weekly \u2018score review\u2019 on Sunday evening; celebrate any metric that improves, even by 1 point.",
    "Maintain data capture: if you miss a day, simply resume\u2014no back-logging needed; focus on streaks, not perfection."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Across 20 health-score samples, physical domains (well-being 44.4, activity 39.1, sleep 40.2) are low, pointing to foundational deficits. Subjective vitality remains high (Energy 81.1, Mental 72.6), suggesting the user feels good despite sub-optimal recovery behaviors\u2014classic risk for silent accumulation of fatigue. Sleep markers show only one full-night record: time-in-bed ~6 h with efficiency <85 %, multiple awakenings, and mid-sleep around 03:30 AM, all consistent with circadian instability. Calories logged once, indicating nutrition tracking is not yet a habit. Four activity logs in seven days average \u22482300 steps per session\u2014below guideline. Immediate priority: solidify sleep timing and daily low-barrier movement to lift the weakest metrics first.",
