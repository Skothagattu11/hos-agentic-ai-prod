OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "User is at the very beginning of their health-tracking journey (Foundation Builder archetype) with a complete absence of logged activity, sleep, or biomarker data for 2025-08-17 to 2025-08-18. This suggests either (a) onboarding is still in progress or (b) the user is experiencing friction or uncertainty about how to start. The dominant behavioral pattern is therefore \u2018data silence,\u2019 indicating the need for confidence building and extremely simple first steps.",
    "confidence": 0.25
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 8,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "No data captured, no evidence of prior tracking habits, and no observable engagement signals\u2014all typical of someone new to structured health optimization."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a consistent, friction-free data-tracking routine that captures basic activity (steps), sleep duration, and one baseline biomarker.",
    "timeline": "Within the next 4 weeks",
    "success_metrics": "\u2022 \u226580 % of days with at least one activity metric and one sleep record during any rolling 14-day window\n\u2022 First baseline biomarker (e.g., body-weight or blood-pressure reading) logged within 30 days"
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Quick wins, visible progress, and reassurance that \u2018something is better than nothing\u2019.",
    "habit_integration": "Anchor tracking to existing daily routines (e.g., log sleep upon waking, allow phone or wearable to auto-count steps, review data during evening wind-down). Use a simple one-tap checklist until confidence grows.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Provide a brief onboarding tutorial; enable automatic device/app syncing to eliminate manual entry; set one gentle daily reminder; highlight small achievements to reinforce momentum."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Low",
  "recommendations": [
    "Connect a wearable or activate the smartphone\u2019s built-in step counter today and keep it on throughout the day.",
    "Tomorrow morning, record last night\u2019s estimated sleep duration in the app or a simple journal\u2014don\u2019t worry about precision yet.",
    "Choose one baseline biomarker (body-weight is easiest); record it once this week, ideally under similar conditions each time (e.g., morning after bathroom).",
    "Set a single, non-intrusive reminder at 9 p.m. to open the app, confirm data sync, and check off the day\u2019s tracking.",
    "Review progress after 7 days; if \u22655 days were successfully tracked, acknowledge the win and continue. If not, identify what blocked you (time, know-how, tech issues) and address just that one blocker.",
    "After two consistent weeks, consider adding one new metric (e.g., hydration or mood rating) but only if the basic trio (steps, sleep, biomarker) feels automatic."
  ],
  "data_insights": "Because no activity, sleep, or biomarker entries were captured during the observation window, no physiological trends can be analyzed. The absence of data itself is the key insight, indicating an onboarding or engagement gap that must be closed before any deeper health optimization can occur.",
