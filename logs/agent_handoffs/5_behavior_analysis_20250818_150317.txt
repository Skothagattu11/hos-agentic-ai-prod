OUTPUT DATA:
----------------------------------------
{
  "behavioral_signature": {
    "signature": "At this initial engagement the user presents as a classic Foundation Builder who has taken the first step of joining the program but has not yet begun consistent self-tracking. The total absence of activity, sleep, or biomarker records suggests (a) low familiarity with tracking tools and/or (b) uncertainty about how to get started. This points to a behavior pattern characterized by high intent but low operationalization.",
    "confidence": 0.25
  },
  "sophistication_assessment": {
    "score": 15,
    "category": "Beginner",
    "justification": "Data quality is flagged as POOR with 0 % coverage, indicating that the user is still at the very first stage of health-tracking literacy and habit formation."
  },
  "primary_goal": {
    "goal": "Establish a reliable baseline by recording at least one week of core health metrics (sleep, daily steps, resting heart-rate, basic nutrition log).",
    "timeline": "Weeks 1-4",
    "success_metrics": "\u2265 80 % daily data capture for sleep and steps; at least three biomarker or vitals entries (e.g., blood pressure) by the end of week 4."
  },
  "personalized_strategy": {
    "motivation_drivers": "Simplicity, quick wins, and building confidence through visible progress.",
    "habit_integration": "1) Link tracking to existing daily anchors (e.g., put wearable on immediately after brushing teeth). 2) Use a one-tap mobile checklist each evening to confirm data upload. 3) Celebrate streaks of three consecutive days to reinforce consistency.",
    "barrier_mitigation": "Provide clear, minimal setup instructions; set automated reminders at preferred times; offer a \u2018daily essentials\u2019 view so the user is not overwhelmed by extra metrics."
  },
  "readiness_level": "Medium",
  "recommendations": [
    "Choose one tracking device or phone app today\u2014whichever feels easiest\u2014and enable automatic step and sleep capture.",
    "Start a 10-minute intentional walk after one fixed daily cue (e.g., post-lunch) to create an effortless movement baseline.",
    "Set a consistent bedtime alarm 30 minutes before target sleep time to initiate a simple wind-down routine.",
    "Log water intake once per day in the app to practice using the tracking interface without data overload.",
    "Schedule a follow-up check-in on day 7 to review captured data and adjust the plan."
  ],
  "data_insights": "No actionable physiological or behavioral trends can be extracted yet because the current data set contains zero entries. The immediate insight is that establishing any data flow is the critical first milestone; once a minimum of 7 consecutive days of tracking is available, meaningful pattern analysis can begin.",
