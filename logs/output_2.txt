      "signature": "During the first 8-day observation window the user has logged data with perfect coverage, suggesting a high initial engagement-momentum typical of a motivated Foundation Builder. Sleep, activity and overall wellbeing scores are all clustered in the 0.82-0.87 range, indicating that basic lifestyle practices (bedtime regularity, daily movement) are already generating positive feedback. Readiness, however, lags at 0.67, hinting at either accumulated fatigue or limited recovery capacity. The pattern shows a user who follows through on simple, clearly defined tasks but may need guidance on pacing and recovery to avoid early burnout.",
